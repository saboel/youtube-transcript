# youtube-transcript
Originally was using selenium to scrape transcripts but that proved a pita so decided to just use the youtube-transcript-api to display transcripts on a nice gui using customtkinter.  

## How to Run:
Assuming you have Python installed and correctly set up in your PATH environment variable then just head to the root of the project and issue:
```
python root_main.py
```
### Future plans: 
Currently, the application has a basic functionality that allows users to use the Ctrl+F shortcut to highlight specific phrases in the displayed transcript. This feature is particularly useful for long podcasts that can span an hour or more.
